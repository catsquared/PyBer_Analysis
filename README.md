# PyBer Analysis

## Overview

### Purpose
Using your Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, you’ll create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, you’ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, you’ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

### Data files
Two raw data files are provided:
1. city_data.csv contains the name of the city, how many drivers are in the city, and the type of city - one of urban, suburban, and rural
2. ride_data.csv contains the city, date, fare paid, and ride ID for each ride from January to April


## Results

Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

Deliverable 2: A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type

### Comparing ride-sharing data by city type
- Total Rides
    - The number of Urban rides is 
- Total Drivers
    - The number of Urban drivers is
- Total Fares
    - The total fares for Urban cities is
- Average Fare per Ride
    - Rural cities' average fare per ride is the highest amongst the three types of cities
- Average Fare per Driver
    - Rural cities' average fare per driver is also the highest amongst the three types of cities. 

## Summary
Use your repository README file to write your analysis of how to address any disparities in the ride-sharing data among the city types.
There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types. (4 pt)
Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
